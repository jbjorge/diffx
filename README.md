# Diffx

## Introduction

Diffx is a state management library that focuses on being easy to learn and use, and to offer a great development
experience at any scale.

### Features

* Minimal API
* Minimal boilerplate
    * No forced usage patterns
    * Change any state from anywhere
    * Proxy/mutation based
* Tracking of asynchronous and nested changes to state
* Built in support for persistence
* Supports all major frameworks
* Built with typescript
* Devtools browser extension

### Why choose Diffx?

There are **a lot** of great state management libraries out there.  
Some focus on a rigid structure, suitable for large teams that want predictable code patterns, sometimes at the cost of
writing a lot of boilerplate code.  
Others give freedom to the developers to use it how they see fit at the cost of potentially losing control due to lack
of structure/patterns.

Diffx aims to get rid of the need for patterns by making it the library's responsibility to stay in control, and
let the developer stay on top of any shenanigans with the devtools extension.

#### Goals of Diffx

* be quick and easy to learn
* write as little code as possible
* use it with any framework
* allow developers to interact with the state however they want
* stay in control with the devtools extension

#### Is it better than Redux/Zustand/Mobx/Valtio/Vuex/Recoil/jotai/...?

I don't know. I haven't spent time trying all of them (yet).  
There are a heap of great choices out there, and the library you end up using will probably stay in your project for
a long time.  
I recommend you to look into several of the popular ones and see if you like them better than Diffx.
